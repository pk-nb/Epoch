# Epoch

A webapp for viewing and sharing timelines.

This was originally a senior class project for pk-nb, IsaacHermans, and Jwashton. The official version is hosted at [epoch.tools](http://epoch.tools). Feel free to give it a try! This project is no longer under active development.

## Project Structure

This webapp uses a Rails back end and React.js/HTML5 Canvas for the front end. The Rails app should be fairly [standard](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-the-blog-application) as far as where things are located. The client side code is all located in [app/assets/javascripts/ui-components](app/assets/javascripts/ui-components).
